### Backend

* As of this moment I am using MongoDB for data and mongoose to connect to a hosted database
* It is also used to store all the data 
* I am also using Express to define routes and middlewares as well as other packages in-order to build a complete backend API that recieves requests and sends back responses
* I am using JWT tokens in-order to implement user's Authentication and Authorization allowing different resource access to users and admins
